Offcourse is the TESLA Model S for learning.

By transforming crowd-sourced lists of handpicked resources into sequences of smart-recommendations, Offcourse suggest the best resources for your interests, learning style, and skill level at the right time. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

Sometimes, however, you want to go in a direction no one (not even the best algorithm) can predict. No problem, Offcourse allows you to continuously adjust the direction of your learning. You decide where you will go next.
