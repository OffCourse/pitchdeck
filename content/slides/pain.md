We believe that by finding the right resources at the right time, you can teach 
yourself how to code and find a job. 69,1 % of professional programmers is 
self-taught (source: Stack Overflow). But there are two problems:

1. It’s hard to know where to start   
2. It’s hard to know what to learn next   

This is where Offcourse comes in to help. 

Offcourse makes learning simple.
