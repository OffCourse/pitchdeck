People are already creating and sharing these learning resources for free. We 
want to tap into this spirit of sharing, and use the spirit of open-source and
open-content to grow our user base.

In an attempt to monetize the appreciation of our users for the content 
providers we will offer so-called *arigato* bundles. An *arigato* is basically 
a symbolic amount of money (+/- 10 cent) to show the creator that you 
appreciate her  work. As a company, we will take 10% out of each 
micro-transaction.
