Offcourse taps into a spirit of sharing. Because people are already creating and sharing learning resources for free everywhere. We want to use this spirit of open-source and open-content to grow our user base. 

And to show creators that you appreciate their work, you can purchase an *arigato* bundle. *Arigato* means thank you in Japanese. On Offcourse, an *arigato* is a symbolic amount (say, 10 cents) to say thank you. To sustain the platform, Offcourse takes 10% from each micro-transaction.
