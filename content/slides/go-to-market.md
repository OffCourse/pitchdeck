in coding, people of are very open to new ways of learning (online, bootcamps, 
conferences, etc.) Also, the job market for coders is very open to people from
a non-traditional background

As a first step, we will focus on instructors in the coding space. Ranging from 
trainers, bloggers, video instructors, to senior team members. When they are
using enthousiastic about *offcourse* they automatically also spread it to their
