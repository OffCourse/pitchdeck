Learning takes place more and more outside of traditional institutions. Especially in coding. And the job market for coders is open to people who’ve taught themselves how to do this. 96,1% of professional programmers is self-taught (source: Stack Overflow).

That’s why we focus on instructors in the coding space as a first step. These instructors can be trainers, bloggers, video instructors to senior team members. Reaching 1 instructor means reaching as many of 5 to 100.000 students. And the *arigato* system makes it profitable for instructors to share their knowledge.
