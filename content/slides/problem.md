Currently, however, there aren't is any decent support to facilitate your
way of learning.

### Traditional Education

- Takes too much Time
- Is too expensive
- Doesn't prepare you for the real world

### Online Tools

- Don't tell you where to start
- Don't tell you where to go next
- Don't separate good from bad

This is where Offcourse comes in to help
