But right now, there’s no support to facilitate \[*describe ‘your way of learning’: online self-learning, independent learning efforts…?*\]. 

### Traditional Education

* Takes too much Time
* Is too expensive
* Doesn't prepare you for the real world

### Online Tools

* Don't tell you where to start
* Don't tell you where to go next
* Don't separate good from bad

This is where Offcourse comes in to help
