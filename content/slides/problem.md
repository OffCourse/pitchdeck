Up until now, people that pursue a lifelong of just-in-time learning, are lacking the right tools.
Both a traditional  education and its online counterpart are unfit for the job.

### Traditional Education

* Takes too much time
* Is too expensive
* Doesn't prepare you for the real world

### Online Tools

* Don't tell you where to start
* Don't tell you where to go next
* Don't separate good from bad

This is where Offcourse comes in to help
