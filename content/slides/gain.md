Offcourse is a free and open online tool that helps learners to collect links 
to the best learning resources on the web and share them with others.
 
Offcourse allows you to personalize other peopleâ€™s lists to make them suit your 
learning goals. Offcourse will also feature smart learning analytics and 
recommendations, providing valuable insight in how you learn and to recommend you 
what blog post, article or podcast to read or listen to next. 

Offcourse is the course that follows you, instead of the other way around.
