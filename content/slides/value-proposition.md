Offcourse is the TESLA for learning.

Offcourse suggests the best resources for your interests, learning style and skill level at the right time. How? By transforming crowd-sourced lists of hand picked resources into a smart stream of recommendations. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

Want to go in a direction that no one can predict? Not even the best algorithm? No problem. You can adjust the course of your own learning. You decide where you go next.
