Offcourse is the TESLA Model S for learning.

By transforming crowd-sourced lists of handpicked resources into sequences of 
smart-recommendations, Offcourse suggest the best resources for your interests, 
learning style, and skill level at the right time. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

Sometimes, however, you want to go in a direction that no one (not even the 
best algorithm) can predict. No problem, Offcourse allows you to continuously 
adjust the course of your learning. You decide where you go next.
